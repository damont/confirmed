Need to add a file named apikey.py with a one liner...
newsapi_key = '<insert apikey from newsapi.org here>'

Once this is added at the same level as confirmed.py, simply run confirmed.py
and it should print a list of headlines along with the percentage of 
sources the headlines appeared in.

Thanks and enjoy.
